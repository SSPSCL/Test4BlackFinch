Test for BlackFinch by Sam Smith
================================
This is a model of a more complex parser.

A fake DI container is user (i.e. a dictionary).

Less validation is used than might be with more time.

There are no unit tests.

The instructions are to spend one hour and so the work has been cut down accordingly as above.
